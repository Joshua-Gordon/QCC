Notes on installing quipper on Ubuntu Linux (Xenial 16.04 LTS)

1. sudo apt-get install haskell-platform

   Troubleshooting: 
   Make sure ghc is *NOT* version 7.10.
   Otherwise install the latest ghc (from website): generic 64-bit
   - wget https://haskell.org/platform/download/8.4.3/haskell-platform-8.4.3-unknown-posix--full-x86_64.tar.gz
   - extract and install

2. cabal update
3. cabal install mtl
4. cabal install primes (*further issues)
5. cabal install Lattices (*further issues)
6. cabal install zlib
7. cabal install easyrender (*further issues)
8. cabal install fixedprec
9. cabal install newsynth
10. cabal install containers
11. cabal install set-monad

   - Issue with set-monad:
   Redeclaration error. Use wget on set-monad from hackage.
   Comment out the instance of Monoid in Data/Set/Monad.hs.
   Move the Data directory in the quipper-0.8 directory.

12. Download the quipper tarball. Extract and install.

   - ISSUE: Data.Map
     Goto quipper-0.8/quipper/Quipper:
	 In Printing.hs: 
		change "import Data.Map (Map)" to "import Data.Map.Strict (Map)"
		change next line to "import qualified Data.Map.Strict as Map"
		find both instances of "insertWith'" to "insertWith"

   - ISSUE: ShowAll
	 Goto quipper-0.8/Libraries:
     In ShowAll.hs: 
		comment out Show instance a -> b.

   - ISSUE: Lattices.Math conflicts with HaskellForMaths.Math.
     	both import Math.Algebra.LinearAlgebra and/or Math.LinearAlgebra.
     	HaskellForMaths contains missing items used by Lattices.Math.
	 Grab Lattices and HaskellForMaths from hackage (via wget)
     Extract both. From Lattices.Math directory, there are 2 subdirectories,
     Lattices and LinearAlgebra. Move them both into the HaskellForMaths/src/Math directory.
     Finally, move that Math directory into quipper-0.8.

   - ISSUE: Primes
	 wget from hackage. Move the Numbers folder from Data into quipper-0.8/Data.
     This is the same folder that set-monad is in earlier.

   - ISSUE: Graphics in easyrender
     wget from hackage. Move the Graphics folder into quipper-0.8. [Josh: is this good?]

13. Install acroread (for viewing circuits)
	Do the following commands:
		sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine:i386 libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 libatk-adaptor:i386 libgail-common:i386
		sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ precise partner"
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install adobereader-enu
		sudo add-apt-repository -r "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ precise partner"
		sudo apt-get update
